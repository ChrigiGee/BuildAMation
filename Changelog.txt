21-Sep-2015 First check whether a package repository exists before enumerating it for packages.

21-Sep-2015 Fixes #7. Unhandled exceptions fell through the bam executable. Now catch and report them, for a cleaner exit.

19-Sep-2015 The Bam test harness can now specify other package repositories to test, as well as the default in Bam. There is a requirement of a bamtests.py in the tests folder of each repository, naming each valid Test, and the build modes in which it can be run.

18-Sep-2015 bam --version now reports the directory containing the Bam core assembly.

18-Sep-2015 Dependent package definition files did not add their package repositories into the search paths, in order to resolve all packages they reference.

18-Sep-2015 ======== Version 1.0a2 Release ========

18-Sep-2015 C.ConsoleApplication.RequiredToExist<T> now accepts a comma separated list of modules to apply public patches of T to. This is used, for instance, for plugins that do not need to be linked against an application, but do expose a header to compile against.

18-Sep-2015 Public patches on a module are now inherited by all modules that reside within it. For example, a C static library has a public patch to provide an include path; all source containers within that static library automatically use that patch.

17-Sep-2015 ======== Version 1.0a1 Release ========

16-Sep-2015 Next target version set to 1.0.
