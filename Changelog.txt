22-Jan-2011 Issue #15. Added the Moc tool to Qt, with NativeBuilder support. Renamed Qt-2010.05 to Qt-4.7.1 as this system only needs the framework libraries, and not the full development SDK (and has VisualC support).

22-Jan-2011 OpusOptionInterfacePropertyGenerator allows for comments at the start of the interface file.

22-Jan-2011 Exceptions thrown at the point of toolchain registration are reported better.

21-Jan-2011 Fixed bad regular expression in CodeGenTest-dev test package. This stopped the WindowsSDK from being added as a dependency.

21-Jan-2011 Issue #21. Module injections did not work for module collections.

20-Jan-2011 Issue #18. The API for setting relative paths has been made more robust, but with the consequence that some file specifications have moved out of field initializers to class constructors.

20-Jan-2011 Opus.Core.DependencyNodeEnumerator no longer throws an exception when the DependencyGraph is empty.
