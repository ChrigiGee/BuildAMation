26-Jan-2011 Fixing unused variable warnings compiling Opus in MonoDevelop

23-Jan-2011 Issue #6. Added command line configuration argument to Qt; -Qt.installpath=<path> to override Opus searching for the Qt install directory.

23-Jan-2011 Added Opus.Core.State.RunningMono to detect whether Mono is being used.

23-Jan-2011 Issue #9. Added versioning to package compilation; the define OPUS_CORE_VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR is set in the compiler, where MAJOR and MINOR are the major and minor versions of the Opus.Core.dll assembly. Added new Opus.Core.State functions; Version to get the System.Version and VersionString to get the reduced major/minor string version.

23-Jan-2011 Fields marked as source files to C# assemblies can now be either Opus.Core.File or Opus.Core.FileCollection.

23-Jan-2011 Removed GetNestedDependents from Opus.Core.IModule and added it to its own interface Opus.Core.INestedDependents. Not all modules expect to have nested dependencies, so should not have to implement this function.

22-Jan-2011 Correcting a typo constructing the Windows Qt Moc executable pathname.

22-Jan-2011 Support for detecting Qt on Unix in the default installation location; updated Moc and a test package.

22-Jan-2011 Adding more required Gcc include paths when -nostdinc is used; this is to find headers like limits.h

22-Jan-2011 Fixed adding linker search paths in GCC.

22-Jan-2011 Added Qt-4.6.3 package.

22-Jan-2011 Issue #15. Added the Moc tool to Qt, with NativeBuilder support. Renamed Qt-2010.05 to Qt-4.7.1 as this system only needs the framework libraries, and not the full development SDK (and has VisualC support).

22-Jan-2011 OpusOptionInterfacePropertyGenerator allows for comments at the start of the interface file.

22-Jan-2011 Exceptions thrown at the point of toolchain registration are reported better.

21-Jan-2011 Fixed bad regular expression in CodeGenTest-dev test package. This stopped the WindowsSDK from being added as a dependency.

21-Jan-2011 Issue #21. Module injections did not work for module collections.

20-Jan-2011 Issue #18. The API for setting relative paths has been made more robust, but with the consequence that some file specifications have moved out of field initializers to class constructors.

20-Jan-2011 Opus.Core.DependencyNodeEnumerator no longer throws an exception when the DependencyGraph is empty.

19-Jan-2011 Adding Changelog.txt

18-Jan-2011 When searching for script files, use a recursive directory search.

18-Jan-2011 Fixed debug message typo; should be platform, not configuration.
